# QEfficient — Agent Instructions

QEfficient adapts Hugging Face Transformers models to run efficiently on Qualcomm
Cloud AI 100/ AI200 (QAIC) hardware via a PyTorch → ONNX export → AOT compile → on-device
runtime pipeline. The guiding principle is **minimal divergence from upstream HF**
while preserving PyTorch ↔ ONNX ↔ on-device parity.

## Useful commands
- Install (editable): `pip install -e .`
- Install with test extras: `pip install -e .[test]` (adds `pytest`, `pytest-mock`, `pytest-xdist`)
- Install quality tools: `pip install -e .[quality]`
- Lint + format (required before a PR): `pre-commit run --all-files`
  - Ruff (lint + format), config in `pyproject.toml`: line-length 120, isort enabled, target py310.
  - Or directly: `ruff check --fix .` then `ruff format .`
- Run tests: `pytest -n auto <path-or-expr>`
  - Narrow first with `-k '<expr>'`, then widen once green.
  - Always run the appropriate tests after refactoring code, adding features,
    onboarding models, or making comparable behavioral changes.
  - If no suitable tests exist for newly added code, add focused tests in the
    appropriate existing test location before validating the change.
  - Tests are tagged with markers (see `pyproject.toml`): `on_qaic`, `cli`, `finetune`,
    `multimodal`, `qnn`, `diffusion_models`, `regular`, `nightly`, `vllm`, `wan`, `flux`.
  - `on_qaic` / `qnn` tests require QAIC hardware and will not run on plain CPU hosts.

## Acceptance gate
- Several skills reference `tests/test_model_quickcheck.py` as the consolidated
  acceptance gate. If that file is not present in your checkout, fall back to the
  most relevant subsystem tests under `tests/` (for example `tests/transformers/`)
  and clearly state in the PR which tests you ran and why.
- Never claim parity from export/compile success alone: validate
  HF PyTorch → QEff PyTorch → ONNXRuntime where the skill calls for it.

## Repository map
- Model wrappers: `QEfficient/transformers/models/*/modeling_*.py`
- HF → QEff replacement wiring: `QEfficient/transformers/models/pytorch_transforms.py`
- Auto / export / runtime glue: `QEfficient/transformers/models/modeling_auto.py`
- Cache abstractions: `QEfficient/transformers/cache_utils.py`
- Base export logic: `QEfficient/base/modeling_qeff.py`
- Runtime input + cache helpers: `QEfficient/utils/generate_inputs.py`, `QEfficient/utils/run_utils.py`
- Examples: `examples/`
- Tests + fixtures: `tests/`, `tests/conftest.py`

## Conventions
- Keep changes surgical and consistent with surrounding code; prefer fixing root causes.
- Treat public APIs, model inputs/outputs, cache layouts, tensor names, artifact formats,
  compile options, and runtime semantics as contracts. If one must change, make the
  compatibility impact and validation path explicit.
- Keep model-specific facts close to the owning wrapper. Promote logic into shared helpers
  only when it removes real duplication across model families or isolates a volatile boundary.
- Debug from concrete evidence: exact commands, tracebacks, ONNX nodes, graph dumps, compiler
  logs, QPC paths, tensor shapes, dtypes, and measured numerical differences.
- Treat `pyproject.toml` as read-only. Agents must not edit it, change its mode,
  or add/remove dependency, tool, build-system, marker, or test configuration entries.
  If such a change appears necessary, stop and hand off the exact proposed diff or file-mode request
  to a human maintainer instead.
- Keep tuple-cache compatibility wherever shared export/runtime code expects the legacy layout.
- Follow SOLID principles when writing code. If a change must intentionally diverge
  from SOLID for compatibility, performance, export constraints, or minimal-risk
  integration, call that out to the user with the reason.
- Avoid speculative extension points, broad registries, or configuration surfaces for
  hypothetical future cases.
- Always use signed-off commits with `git commit -s`.
- Keep code standards high: follow PEP 8 for Python, including naming variables,
  classes, functions, and modules appropriately and maintaining clean import order.
  Avoid commented-out code, and never leave breakpoints, ad-hoc debug prints, or
  temporary debugging hooks.
- Do not add new test files when an existing test (or the quickcheck gate) can carry the regression.
- For regressions, reproduce the real failing boundary when feasible. Reduced repros are acceptable
  only when they exercise the same mechanism as the reported failure.

## Working style
- Before broad or risky changes, state the current architecture, what is changing,
  preserved compatibility surfaces, and the validation boundary.
- Prefer narrow, faithful validation first, then widen to subsystem tests, quickcheck,
  export/compile, ONNXRuntime, or QAIC checks as the change requires.
- Report handoff evidence in reviewer-friendly terms: commands run, pass/fail results,
  artifact paths when relevant, known gaps, and hardware/cache limitations.

## Required user inputs
- Ask the user for the virtualenv path only when there is a real need to execute
  Python-dependent commands, such as `python`, `pip`, `pytest`, `ruff`, or
  `pre-commit`; otherwise do not ask.
- Ask the user for `HF_HUB_CACHE` before downloading or loading any model.
- Set `HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1` whenever downloading models from Hugging Face.
- For export/compile work that produces QEff artifacts, choose an appropriate
  local `QEFF_HOME` without asking whenever possible. Ask the user only when an
  existing required location cannot be inferred or choosing one could overwrite,
  hide, or invalidate artifacts the user likely needs.

## Contribution policy
- Follow the fork → branch → PR flow in `CONTRIBUTING.md`; sync from `upstream/main`.
- Always run the relevant linter and formatter at the end of code changes, and
  address the findings instead of leaving avoidable style issues.
- A human submitter must understand and be able to defend every AI-assisted change
  end-to-end, and must review every changed line and run the relevant tests.
- Disclose AI assistance and the exact test commands run in the PR description.
- Agents must not open, raise, submit, or publish pull requests directly. Agents may
  only prepare local changes, validation evidence, and PR handoff text for a human
  maintainer to review and submit.
- Agents must not add, remove, request, or suggest bypass labels such as
  `maintainer-approved-pyproject-change`; only human maintainers may apply
  workflow-bypass labels after reviewing the proposed change.
- Do not open low-value busywork PRs or duplicate existing open PRs/issues.

## Local agent setup
- Skills live under `skills_studio/skills/`. Each skill is a `SKILL.md` plus optional
  `references/` and `scripts/`.
- Local OpenAI Codex agents: run `make codex` after cloning to wire skills under `.agents/skills`.
- Local Claude Code agents: run `make claude` after cloning to wire skills under `.claude/skills`.
- Remove the generated links with `make clean-ai`. The `.agents/` and `.claude/`
  directories are gitignored; only `skills_studio/` is tracked.

## Available skills
Use a skill when the task matches its description. Open the `SKILL.md` for the full workflow.

- `transformers-mainline-rebase` — Rebase QEff wrappers onto a newer HF Transformers
