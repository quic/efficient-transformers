Researchers at Harvard have created a microrobot that is smaller than a penny. The robot is made of a flexible polymer that can be folded and unfolded to move. It is powered by a laser and can be controlled by a computer. The robot is able to move on its own, but it can also be controlled remotely. It can be used to deliver drugs or to perform other tasks. A 1-minute video that shows the robot in action is available in the article.

A new study has found that the brain of an old person can still make new neurons. The study was conducted by a team of researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles. The team studied the brains that were able to make new neurons. The team found that the brains of these people were able to make new neurons in the hippocampus, which is the part of the brain that is responsible for memory and learning. The team also found that the brains of these people were able to make new neurons in the cortex, which is the part of the brain that is responsible for thinking and reasoning. The team also found that the brains of these people were able to make new neurons in the cerebellum, which
